# Blockchain-based Decentralized Relief Funds Distribution

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity for smart contract development, Web3 for interaction with the blockchain, and Node.js for the backend. The frontend is implemented using HTML and CSS.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a transparent and efficient system for distributing relief funds in times of crisis. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to increase donor participation and trust in the distribution process.

## Features

- **Transparent Fund Distribution**: The use of smart contracts ensures that fund distribution is transparent and can be verified by anyone on the blockchain.
- **ERC20 Tokenization**: The project implements ERC20 tokens to represent the funds, allowing for easy transfer and tracking of funds.
- **Real-time Fund Management**: The dApp provides real-time updates on fund allocation and distribution, increasing accountability.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the Node.js server: `node server.js`
4. Access the dApp in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

- **Donor**: Can view the current status of the relief funds, donate funds, and track the distribution process.
- **Recipient**: Can submit requests for fund allocation and track the approval process.
- **Administrator**: Manages the overall fund distribution process, approves fund allocation requests, and ensures transparency.
